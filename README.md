# RLC-Circuits-C-
An object oriented programme to model RLC components 
This programme allows a user to enter an arbitrary number of components, specify their characteristics and 
connect them in series or parallel to create a circuit. It will then allow the user to display a diagram of the circuit along with 
its various characteristics (total impedance for example).

A more comprehensive explainination of the code can be found in the file 'AC Circuits', which contains a report on the project.
